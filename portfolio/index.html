        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <p>I am a budding software engineer currently enrolled in the Full Stack 
        bootcamp at PDX Code Guild 
        persueing a Full Stack Web Devloper Certificate and will graduate 
        in October 2022.</p>
        <p>I live in Moretown, Vermont with my Wife, our two cats, and our dog Harry.
        Outside of Web development I enjoy spending time with my Family, woodworking, 
        swimming in the river at the end of the road during the summer and 
        skiing during the winter.
        I feel extremely grateful to have found this program which has given me the tools
        to succede in a new career. I absolutely love the constant problem solving and
        only wish I had started down this path sooner.
        </p>
